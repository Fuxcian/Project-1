This program functions as so:
  First it imports statements to help to program read json files to translate any future information pulled off of the internet.
  Then it requests to user to enter a Wikipedia Title, which will be referenced to pull data later.
  Then it takes said title and condenses it into readable format for JSON.
  Then it searches that title online and withdraws information in similar JSON format. It is arranged to only withdraw information
    under the reivisons and timestamps sections of the JSON data we collected from our title page on Wikipedia.
  Finally it displays the information in readable format from our original collection of JSON data.
